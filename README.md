# ReadyFile AI

A law school class prototype. It helps a person who is filing an Indiana
stalking or harassment protection order petition online organize her story
into separate incidents. Then it asks the questions a court protective order
specialist would ask at the counter, before she files.

**Use only fictional sample data.** The tool stores nothing and sends nothing
anywhere, but it is a prototype and has not been reviewed for real use.

The full build brief is in [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md).

## How to run it

You need Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # opens at http://localhost:5173
npm test           # runs all tests once
npm run build      # type-checks and builds to dist/
```

In development mode (`npm run dev`):

- The story screen shows two buttons that fill in the fictional "Lena"
  sample: one with 1 incident, one with 4 incidents.
- Each check question from an unverified rule shows a yellow
  "Unverified rule" badge with the rule's id.

Neither appears in a production build.

To try the AI splitter stub, start the app with `VITE_ENABLE_LLM=true npm run dev`.
See "The incident splitter" below.

## The four screens

1. **Start:** she picks Stalking, Harassment, or Not sure. If she picks
   nothing, she continues as "Not sure".
2. **Tell your story:** she writes in her own words, then the splitter breaks
   the story into draft incidents. She can edit, merge, delete, or add
   incidents, and she confirms the final list herself.
3. **Check:** the rule checker asks one question at a time. Each question has
   "Add more" and "Continue as is", with equal visual weight. "Add more" takes
   her to the field the question is about.
4. **Review:** a plain-text summary she can copy or print. The screen says
   clearly that the tool does not file anything.

## What each content file controls

Your team can edit these files without touching code. The dev server reloads
them right away. For a production build, run `npm run build` again.

| File | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| [content/copy.json](content/copy.json) | All on-screen text, plus the quick exit address (`quickExit.url`). `{name}` marks a value the app fills in, such as `{n}` for an incident number. |
| [content/rules.json](content/rules.json) | The check questions. Each rule has `id`, `caseTypes`, `condition`, `questionText`, `sourceCitation`, and `verified`. |
| [content/resources.json](content/resources.json) | The advocate contacts behind "Talk to an advocate". An entry with `verified: false` shows a "Not checked yet" label. |

### Rule conditions

A rule can only use one of these conditions, so every question traces back to
one rule. Rules cannot contain code.

| `condition.type` | Asks when… |
| --- | --- |
| `incidentCountBelow` | the number of incidents is below `value` (asked once) |
| `incidentDateMissing` | an incident has no date (asked once per incident) |
| `incidentWordsBelow` | an incident's description has fewer than `value` words (asked once per incident) |
| `null` | never. Use this for a placeholder rule. |

If `rules.json` has a mistake, such as an unknown condition type, the app
stops with an error that names the rule.

The checker ([src/checker/](src/checker/)) has no React and no app code.
Another tool, such as a court e-filing site or an advocate tool, could import
`runChecks(input, rules)` and use it directly.

## Rules still unverified

All four rules are `verified: false`:

| Rule | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `stalking-two-incidents` | Wording from PO-0102 petition booklet (team source K2). Waiting for the team to confirm. |
| `incident-missing-date` | The question wording is a draft, and the source is TODO. |
| `incident-too-short` | The question wording is a draft, and the source is TODO. The 15-word limit is a placeholder. |
| `harassment-rule` | Placeholder with no condition, so it never asks anything. The team will supply this rule. |

## Safety features (section 8)

- **Quick exit:** in the header on every screen, and it stays visible while
  the timeout warning is open. It clears all state, then leaves with
  `location.replace()`. The app never adds browser history entries, so the
  back button cannot return to the tool.
- **Neutral tab:** the browser tab title is "Notes", with a plain document
  icon.
- **No storage:** state lives only in memory. The app uses no
  localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, IndexedDB, or server.
- **No outside calls:** the app uses no analytics, trackers, external fonts,
  or CDN files. Production builds include a Content Security Policy that
  blocks any request to another site.
- **Timeout:** after 14 minutes with no activity, a warning counts down 60
  seconds, with a "Stay here" button. If she doesn't respond, everything is
  cleared and she's back at Start.
- **Advocate contacts:** "Talk to an advocate" is on every screen. All
  contacts come from `resources.json`, and the code contains no phone
  numbers.
- **No autofill history:** text inputs have `autocomplete="off"`, so the
  browser doesn't save what she types.

## The incident splitter

The splitter uses the `IncidentExtractor` interface in
[src/organizer/](src/organizer/). It has two versions:

- **ManualExtractor (default):** starts a new incident at each paragraph, and
  inside a paragraph wherever a sentence starts with a date phrase such as
  "Last week" or "In March". It also fills in any date it finds. Her words are
  never changed.
- **LlmExtractor (off by default, `VITE_ENABLE_LLM=true`):** a **stub**.
  Calling an AI model from the browser would break the no-outside-calls rule
  and expose the API key. So for now it returns prepared drafts for the
  fictional four-incident Lena sample, and uses the manual splitter for
  anything else. Either way, she sees the result as a draft and confirms it
  herself.

## Tests

`npm test` runs 42 tests in [tests/](tests/):

- **Acceptance tests 1–8 from section 12:** `acceptance.test.tsx` covers
  tests 1–6 and 8, and `content.test.ts` covers test 7, the banned-phrase
  scan.
- **Checker and rule validation:** `checker.test.ts`.
- **Splitter and date finding:** `organizer.test.ts`.
- **Source code scans:** checks that the code has no storage calls, network
  calls, history changes, or hardcoded phone numbers.

## Open TODOs

- [ ] Team: verify the wording and source for all four rules, then set `verified: true`.
- [ ] Team: supply the harassment rule.
- [ ] Team: confirm the 15-word limit in `incident-too-short`.
- [ ] Team: fill in and verify every entry in `resources.json`.
- [ ] Team: review all text in `copy.json` for plain language and reading level.
- [ ] Team: confirm the quick exit address (now `https://www.weather.com`).
- [ ] Decide whether to turn off spellcheck in the story box. Some browsers'
      "enhanced" spellcheck sends typed text to a server.
- [ ] Real AI splitter: needs a small server that holds the API key and keeps
      the no-storage rules. It should be used with fictional data only.
- [ ] Accessibility check with a real screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) and a
      contrast checker.
- [ ] Not built yet (section 6): field explainer, follow-up queue, bench
      summary, denial explainer, and domestic violence petitions.
